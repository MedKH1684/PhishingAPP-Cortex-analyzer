# PhishingAPP-Cortex-analyzer
PhishingAPP is a new application that analyzes email files in the ".EML" format. With its API, users can send files and receive detailed results. We created this custom analyzer in Cortex to simplifies the workflow for SOC analysts, allowing them to access the report directly within TheHive platform.
