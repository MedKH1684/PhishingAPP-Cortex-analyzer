# PhishingAPP-Cortex-analyzer
PhishingAPP is a recently developed application designed to analyze email files in the ".EML" format. It provides an API that allows users to send their files and receive comprehensive results. To facilitate the analysis of email files as observables, we have integrated a customized analyzer into Cortex. This integration streamlines the process for SOC analysts, enabling them to directly access the report within TheHive platform.
